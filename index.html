      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Short Strand (<em>An Trá Ghearr</em>) is a compact, working‑class district on the east bank of the River Lagan.
        It is a predominantly Irish nationalist and Catholic community, bordered by largely unionist neighbourhoods of East Belfast.
        Though small in size, the area carries a big story: of survival, civic pride, and the everyday work of building a fairer future.

        <h2>Where is it?</h2>
        <p>
          Short Strand sits within the historic townland of <strong>Ballymacarrett</strong>, framed by the Albertbridge Road to the south,
          Newtownards Road to the north, and the city centre across the Lagan to the west. The landmark
          <strong>St&nbsp;Matthew’s Church</strong> anchors the community at its northeastern edge.

        <h2>Identity & Culture</h2>
        <p>
          Irish language signage, traditional music, and community sport reflect a living Irish identity.
          Murals and memorials remember those lost while calling for equality and self‑determination. Neighbourhood groups,
          youth projects, and the parish hall keep the social fabric strong.

      <h2>History &amp; Resilience</h2>
      <p>
        The Short Strand has long been an <em>interface area</em> where communities meet—sometimes uneasily. Residents endured
        repeated periods of tension and attack during the late 20th century, yet organised to defend homes, care for neighbours,
        and sustain civic life. A few key moments include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>June 1970 — The Battle of St&nbsp;Matthew’s:</strong> violent clashes centred on St&nbsp;Matthew’s Church marked an early, defining
          moment of community defence in the modern conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>April 1975 — Strand Bar bombing:</strong> a loyalist attack on a local pub killed six civilians and injured many more—
          a tragedy still mourned and remembered.</li>
        <li><strong>May–June 2002 — ‘Siege of Short Strand’:</strong> days of intense rioting underscored the need for dialogue, rights, and
          long‑term guarantees for safe, shared streets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Today, <strong>peace lines</strong> and protective fencing still mark parts of the boundary—visible reminders of the past, but also of
        the work underway to replace barriers with trust. From a nationalist viewpoint, the Short Strand’s story is one of steadfastness,
        civil rights, and the aspiration to see the Irish nation reconciled and free.

        <h2>St&nbsp;Matthew’s Church</h2>
        <p>
          More than a place of worship, the church precinct has served as a gathering point in crisis and celebration alike. It remains
          a spiritual and cultural landmark, its bells carrying across the interface to the river and city beyond.

        <h2>Living Here, Visiting Here</h2>
        <p>
          Visitors are welcomed with respect. Photograph thoughtfully, stay mindful around murals and memorials, and support local
          cafés and social clubs. Community‑led tours and cross‑community projects offer rich context for understanding the area’s
          past and present.

      <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The Short Strand shows how a small community can endure hardship and still champion dignity, equality, and Irish cultural
        renewal. Its experience is part of a broader national story—one that looks toward unity built on consent, rights, and
        mutual respect for all who share the island.
